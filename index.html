<h1><font-family=Arial color=black size=24 style=normal></font-family>About Gucci Mane</h1>

<p text-align:right>Gucci Mane, also known as Radric Delantic Davis is a man of many loves. He is a connoisseur of luxury cars, rare jewelry, and clever words. Throughout his career as a rapper he has released a multitude of albums and jail time to boast in those songs. Gucci Mane lives a fast paced life with tons of pass times funded by his net worth and clout on the streets. No matter where you live I would say Gucci is a household name. But he would not have had his famous 1017 records without the help of his buddies T.I. and Young Jeezy.</p>

<h2>What people believe he means in his music</h2>
	<p>Mr. Davis has release a total of twelve studio albums and over 70 mixtapes. His music, while assumed to be simple and similar has a deeper meaning. It does not simply reiterate the fast life of a 	rapper and the materialistic values that money can bring you. It delves into the ideas of the hustle and why you cannot trust anyone in the streets.</p>

<h3>What he means to me and why I like him</h3>
	<p>Radric is not just a rapper in my mind, but a lyrical mogul. His rap is an art that few actually can consume seriously. His melodies and lyric combined with rapid ad-lib use and top tier features such as Migos, Travis Scott, and Lil Pump further his status quo. Understandably, you can assume that Mr. Davis is a favorite for me. One reason is his because his grind is impeccable. The second reason is because I am from Atlanta like him and you have to route for your people.</p>
